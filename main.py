This script interacts with the Pixela API to track coding habits by creating a graph and posting data on a daily basis. 
The user can record the minutes spent coding, update the value for a specific day, or delete an entry.

Steps:
1. Create a user account (already done, hence commented out).
2. Create a graph to track the habit.
3. Post a value (minutes spent coding) to the graph.
4. Update the value for a specific date (commented for reference).
5. Delete an entry from the graph (commented for reference).

#-----------Step1-------------------
#  Step 1: Create user account (already done, so commented out)
